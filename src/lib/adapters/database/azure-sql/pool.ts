 * Opening a TDS connection to Azure SQL Database.
 *
 * A fork of the MSSQL pool rather than a shared module, for two reasons. A change
 * to that one's SSH tunnelling would otherwise silently change this adapter, which
 * has no SSH mode. And the settings below are pinned here rather than offered:
 * Azure presents a real certificate on every connection, so encryption is not a
 * choice and trusting an unverified certificate against *.database.windows.net is
 * always either a mistake or an interception.
 *
 * The `database` option is not a convenience. Azure SQL Database rejects
 * three-part names, so every per-database catalog read needs its own connection.
