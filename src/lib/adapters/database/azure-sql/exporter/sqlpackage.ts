/**
 * BACPAC export and import through Microsoft's SqlPackage.
 *
 * ## The connection string is on argv, and that is a deliberate exception
 *
 * `src/lib/adapters/CLAUDE.md` says secrets go in `options.env`, never in argv.
 * SqlPackage has no environment route and rejects `/SourceConnectionString:@file`
 * (verified against 170.4.83), so the string has to be an argument.
 *
 * The exception holds because of why the rule exists: `SshHost` renders env into
 * an `export` prefix so secrets stay out of the *remote* process table. This
 * adapter has no SSH mode at all, by construction - the schema carries no
 * `connectionMode`, so `standardTransport` always returns a DirectHost. The argv
 * array therefore never touches a shell, and the exposure is the process table of
 * the very container that already holds the password in memory.
 *
 * That bound is structural, not a `host.kind` check, which the transport lint
 * guard forbids for good reason. If an SSH mode is ever added here, this comment
 * stops being true and the secret handling has to be revisited first.
