/**
 * Restoring into a Docker volume.
 *
 * A file arrives as a local path plus the permissions and owner the backup recorded. It goes
 * back as a one-entry tar handed to the container archive endpoint, which applies those from
 * the tar headers - verified before this was designed around, because a restored data
 * directory with the wrong owner is one no database will start on.
 *
 * The tar is always built here rather than passed through from anywhere. A tar produced by a
 * host tool can carry extended attributes the daemon cannot apply, and it fails the whole
 * call over a single one - macOS `bsdtar` stamps `com.apple.provenance` onto every file,
 * which is exactly how that was found.
