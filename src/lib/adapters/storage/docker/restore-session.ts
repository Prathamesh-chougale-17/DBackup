/**
 * One connection and one helper per target volume, for the length of a restore.
 *
 * The restore writes files one at a time through `upload()`, and each target volume needs a
 * container to write into, its holders stopped, and - for an overwrite - its old contents
 * gone. Doing that per file would stop the containers over and over and empty the volume
 * between every write, which is not a restore but a way to end up with one file.
 *
 * Prepared lazily and memoised per volume, because the restore resolves its targets up front
 * but reaches them through a concurrency pool: two files of the same volume can start at the
 * same moment, and only one of them may do the preparing.
