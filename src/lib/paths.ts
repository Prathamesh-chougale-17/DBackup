/**
 * Slash trimming that cannot backtrack.
 *
 * The obvious spellings - `/^\/+/` and `/\/+$/` - are quadratic on a run of slashes. A
 * trailing quantifier is unanchored at the start, so the engine restarts the `+` at every
 * position and backtracks through the rest each time: 40,000 slashes takes about 0.8 s, and
 * every doubling costs four times as much. That is a denial of service on any path that
 * reaches it from a request, which is why CodeQL's `js/polynomial-redos` flags them.
 *
 * These loops do the same job in one pass. Shared rather than rewritten per call site,
 * because the regex version is what everyone reaches for first.
