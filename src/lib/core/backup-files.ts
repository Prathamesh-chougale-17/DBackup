/**
 * Classification of files stored alongside a backup.
 *
 * Every backup writes sidecar files next to the archive itself. Any code that lists a
 * storage destination and asks "which of these are backups?" has to exclude them, and
 * getting that wrong is dangerous rather than cosmetic: retention counts files to decide
 * what to delete, so a sidecar mistaken for a backup can push a real backup out of the
 * keep window and delete it.
 *
 * That is exactly what happened when the `.index` sidecar was introduced - seven separate
 * call sites each hard-coded `!name.endsWith('.meta.json')` and none of them learned about
 * the new suffix. Hence this single source of truth: adding a future sidecar means adding
 * it here, once.
