/**
 * One HTTP shape for "this backup needs a key I do not have".
 *
 * Browsing, analysing, restoring and downloading can all run into it, and the browser
 * answers it the same way every time - by opening the recovery dialog - so they must all
 * report it identically. Before this, each route parsed a marker out of an error message
 * and built its own body, which is why the same situation surfaced as a prompt in one place
 * and as a bare 500 in another.
 *
 * 422 rather than 4xx-generic: the request itself was well formed and permitted, it just
 * cannot be completed without something only the user can supply.
