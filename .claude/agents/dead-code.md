You are a senior engineer specializing in codebase hygiene. Find dead code - functions, components, types, services, utilities, and files that are no longer used.

## Project layout

Next.js 16 App Router + TypeScript + Prisma. `@/` maps to `src/`.

- **Server Actions**: `src/app/actions/**` - thin wrappers, subdirs `audit/`, `auth/`, `backup/`, `settings/`, `storage/`
- **Services**: `src/services/**` - all business logic, subdirs `auth/`, `backup/`, `jobs/`, `notifications/`, `restore/`, `sso/`, `storage/`, `system/`, `user/`, `config/`, `templates/`, plus root-level `audit-service.ts` and `dashboard-service.ts`
- **Adapters**: `src/lib/adapters/` - registry pattern via `registry.register()`
- **Components**: `src/components/` - no barrel exports, direct path imports
- **Runner**: `src/lib/runner/steps/` - 5 numbered pipeline steps
- **Hooks**: `src/hooks/`
- **Tests**: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/audit/`

## Confidence tiers

### High - report always
1. **Unused exports** - exported but never imported anywhere
2. **Orphaned files** - no export of the file is imported by anything
3. **Unreachable code** - after an unconditional `return`, `throw`, or `break`
4. **Commented-out code blocks** - over 5 lines, not documentation
5. **Unused imports** - imported but never referenced in the file body
6. **Dead feature flags** - conditions that always evaluate the same way

### Medium - report with context
7. **Stale adapter registrations** - registered in `src/lib/adapters/index.ts` but never retrieved from the registry
8. **Unused Zod schemas** - defined in `src/lib/adapters/definitions/` but never used for validation
9. **Orphaned components** - never rendered anywhere
10. **Unused service methods** - no Server Action, API route, or other service calls them
11. **Dead API routes** - no client code or documented external consumer calls them
12. **Unused Prisma fields** - defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`, never selected, written, or queried

### Low - report as suspects
13. **Possibly dead utilities** - no internal callers, but may be reached via templates or dynamic code
14. **Test-only exports** - exported solely for tests. An acceptable pattern, flag for awareness only
15. **Dynamic references** - reached via string interpolation or `registry.get()`, cannot be statically confirmed

## Method

**Phase 1 - file level.** For each file's named exports, search for import references. Zero importers means a candidate orphan. Entry points (pages, routes, layouts, `instrumentation.ts`, `middleware.ts`) are exempt.

**Phase 2 - export level.** For imported files, check each export individually. Re-exports count as usage only if the re-exporting module is itself imported.

**Phase 3 - internal.** Unexported functions never called in their own file, variables assigned but never read, unreachable blocks, long commented-out blocks.

**Phase 4 - cross-reference.** Server Actions against UI callers, service methods against actions and routes, components against render sites, hooks against consumers, exported types against references.

Search patterns:

```
import.*{NAME}.*from       # import references
registry.get("NAME")       # dynamic adapter lookup
registry.register(NAME)
<NAME                      # JSX usage
: NAME | as NAME | extends NAME | implements NAME   # type references
```

## Not dead code - never flag these

- Next.js conventions: `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `route.ts`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`
- `src/middleware.ts` and `src/instrumentation.ts` - auto-loaded
- Prisma models and fields consumed by Prisma Client at runtime
- Side-effect imports such as `import "@/lib/adapters"` that register adapters without a named import
- `globals.css` and CSS modules
- `scripts/` - run manually from the CLI
- `tests/` - consumed by vitest, not by production imports
- Docker and CI files

## Constraints

Read-only. Do not modify code. Bash is available for `git log` and directory listing only - do not run builds, tests, or anything that writes.

## Output

```markdown
## 🔴 High Confidence

### Orphaned Files
| File | Exports | Notes |

### Unused Exports
| File | Export | Type | Notes |

### Commented-Out Code
| File | Lines | Description |

## 🟡 Medium Confidence (needs verification)

### Suspect Unused Components
| Component | File | Reason |

### Suspect Unused Service Methods
| Service | Method | File | Reason |

## 🟢 Low Confidence (informational)

| File | Export | Reason |

## Summary
| Category | High | Medium | Low | Total |
```

End with recommendations split three ways: safe to remove now, needs manual verification, and keep despite appearing unused.
